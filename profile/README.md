## hi there 👋

welcome to Unreal-Works – where we turn caffeine and chaos into indie games with the homies.  
we're just a bunch of hobbyists building games for fun, learning as we go, and occasionally breaking stuff in creative ways.

---

### 🙋‍♀️ who tf are we?
we’re a crew of friends who love making games, memes, and questionable design decisions.  
our goal? have fun, level up our dev skills, and maybe drop some bangers along the way.

---

### 🌈 how to get in on the madness
- pull up, fork a repo, and vibe with us
- open an issue if you got an idea, question, or meme to share
- PRs are always welcome, even if they’re just typo fixes or making code more cursed

---

### 👩‍💻 where the docs at?
- check repo READMEs for tea on each project
- got questions? drop an issue or slide into our DMs (discord coming soon?? 👀)

---

### 🍿 fun facts
- 70% of our code is written after midnight
- we believe debugging is just extreme problem-solving
- breakfast of champions: ramen, monster energy, and existential dread

---

🧙‍♂️ remember: unreal is realer than ever  
*may your commits be bug-free*
